    "We can use the PDAL writers.gdal pipeline option to create a raster using GDAL drivers. This allows GDAL to be used to create a raster from scattered point cloud information - although it is not always clear which GDAL routines are being used. A primary and secondary interpolation algorithm may be emplyed depending on the 'window_size' specified. It seems the secondary interpolation approach can only be IDW.\n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "The resulting rasters show:\n",
    "1. Increased IDW power produces a cleaner image when their is LiDAR, but also speckle artifact \n",
    "2. Increased radius produces increased artifact where the desnity of point data changes.\n",
    "   * At the border between LiDAR and the background DEM - the LiDAR bleeds out and dominates the surrounding DEM as radius is increased.\n",
    "   * At the border between the land data (LiDAR and background DEM) and the ocean data (very sparse point data), the land values propagate out without being impacted by any depth measurements (as those typically aren't very dense or close to shore).\n",
    "3. Increased radius does produce increased diameter rings of values around the scattered Bathymetry sounding points.\n",
    "3. Increased window values increases the distance overwhich interpolation is applied where there is no data - in the example this is around bathymetry sounding points and along the coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",
    "* We should include zero values (or negative if at a river mouth) along the coast as otherwise the transition will drift out to sea.\n",
    "* The built-in PDAL / writers.gdal is not flexible enough to cater to this interpolation use-case. \n",
    "* We will want a binning method where there is LiDAR, we will want a simple interpolaton method where there is background DEM, and we will want a smooth and highly continous approach where there is neither. "
